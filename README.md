## Introduction
Welcome to the Malaria Detection Program! This Python-based program is designed to detect malaria parasites in blood cell images using deep learning techniques. Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites transmitted to people through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. Early and accurate diagnosis of malaria is crucial for effective treatment and disease control.

This program uses a pre-trained deep learning model to analyze blood cell images and classify them as either infected or uninfected with malaria parasites.

## Features
- Automatic detection of malaria parasites in blood cell images.
- Fast and efficient analysis of images.
- High accuracy in classifying infected and uninfected cells.
- Easy-to-use command-line interface.
- Compatible with various image formats.

## Installation
To use the Malaria Detection Program, follow these steps:

1. Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine.
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/malaria-detection.git
   ```
2. Install the required Python packages using pip.
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Prepare your blood cell images for analysis. You can use your own dataset or find publicly available malaria blood cell images online.

2. Place the image files in the `input` directory.

3. Run the program by executing the following command:
   ```
   python gen_dataset.py
   python malaria_classification.py
   ```

4. The program will analyze the images and provide results, indicating whether each cell is infected or uninfected.

5. Results will be saved in the `output` directory.

## Dataset
The accuracy of the Malaria Detection Program depends on the quality and diversity of the dataset used for training and testing. You can find publicly available malaria blood cell image datasets online, such as the Malaria Dataset from the National Library of Medicine.

## Model
The program uses a pre-trained deep learning model to perform image classification. The model has been trained on a large dataset of malaria-infected and uninfected blood cell images to achieve high accuracy.
